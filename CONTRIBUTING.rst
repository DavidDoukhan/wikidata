What branch to work on
----------------------

This project follows `Semantic Versioning`_, and every release is tagged.
There are also branches looking like version numbers except of they have only
one period (instead of two), e.g., *0.6*, *0.7*.  These are maintenance
branches.  The branch named *main* [#]_ is for preparing next major version.

If you send a patch to fix a bug your pull request usually should be based on
the latest maintenance branch, not *main*.

If you send a patch to add a new feature it should be based on
the *main* branch.

.. [#] We don't use the term *master*.  For the rationale, please read
   the following discussion and articles:

How to run tests
----------------

As this project supports various Python interpreters (CPython and PyPy) and
versions, to ensure it works well with them, we use tox_.  You don't need to
create a virtual environment by yourself.  ``tox`` automatically creates
virtual environments for various Python versions and run the same test suite
on all of them.

The easiest to install ``tox`` is to use ``pip`` [#]_::

    pip install tox

Once you've installed ``tox``, it's very simple to run the test suite on
all Python versions this project aims to support::

    tox

Note that you need to install Python interpreters besides ``tox``.
If you don't want to install all of them use ``--skip-missing-interpreters``
option::

    tox --skip-missing-interpreters

To run tests on multiple interpreters at a time, use ``--parallel`` option::

    tox --parallel
